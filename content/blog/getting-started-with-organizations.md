# Getting Started with Organizations

Bistro's organization feature lets you collaborate with your team. Here's how to get started.

## Creating an Organization

1. After signing up, you'll be prompted to create your first organization
2. Choose a name and URL-friendly slug
3. You're automatically the **Owner** of organizations you create

## Inviting Team Members

As an Owner or Admin, you can invite others:

1. Navigate to **Members** in the sidebar
2. Click **Invite Member**
3. Enter their email and select a role
4. They'll receive an invitation email

## Understanding Roles

Bistro has four organization roles:

| Role       | Permissions                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Owner**  | Full access, can delete organization |
| **Admin**  | Manage members, settings             |
| **Member** | Standard access to tasks             |
| **Guest**  | Limited read-only access             |

## Switching Organizations

If you're part of multiple organizations:

1. Click the organization switcher in the sidebar
2. Select the organization you want to work in
3. Your context switches immediately

## Best Practices

- **Start small:** Create one organization for your main team
- **Use roles wisely:** Only give Admin access to those who need it
- **Regular cleanup:** Remove inactive members periodically

## What's Next?

Once your organization is set up, start creating tasks and collaborating with your team!
